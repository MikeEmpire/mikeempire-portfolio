        "GroLens is a nationwide ERP for cannabis cultivators that manages all of the customer's data inside of their facility and also manages their data with any 3rd party legal issues that may appear in that state. When it came to GroLens, I built the whole site using react, I mocked up the site using Sketch and some Webï¬‚ow for prototyping. It is a MERN (React) stack project and deployed using AWS with MongoDB. There is also an iOS and Android app available to customers that I rebuilt in React native. In this position, I wore many hats around the company considering I am the co-founder and lead developer.",
